# Bite Book

![Book Bite App Logo]()

## Description

Bite Book is a full-stack web application that allows users to explore various delicious food items, view their details, and place orders for their favorite dishes. The application is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for food enthusiasts to discover and order their desired meals.

This project was developed by me as a learning experience to explore new technology stacks, including Angular, Flask, and Tailwind CSS. As a beginner, I was not familiar with these technologies, but with the help of generative AI and the guidance provided, I was able to learn and implement them effectively within a short period of time.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can create an account and log in to access personalized features.

- **Menu Exploration**: Users can browse through a wide variety of dishes available in the menu.

- **Dish Details**: Each dish in the menu has detailed information, including its name, price, and a brief description.

- **Place Orders**: Authenticated users can place orders for their desired dishes.

- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin users have access to an admin dashboard where they can manage the menu, view orders, and perform various administrative tasks.

- **Review and Ratings**: Users can leave reviews and ratings for dishes they have ordered.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular (with Angular Material for some components)

- **Backend**: Flask (Python) with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL)

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Installation and Setup

1. Install Node.js and npm:

   - Download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
   - npm (Node Package Manager) will be installed along with Node.js.

2. Clone the Bite Book App repository:

   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/salil-01/BiteBook>
   cd BiteBook
   ```

3. Set up the Flask backend:

   - Navigate to the `Book Bite-app/server` directory:
     ```
     cd server
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```
     python3 -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate   # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate      # On Linux / MacOS:
     ```
   - Install Flask and other dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Set up the database and initialize tables (assuming you have PostgreSQL installed):
     ```
     createdb Book Bite_db
     python manage.py db init
     python manage.py db migrate
     python manage.py db upgrade
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add any sensitive data, such as database credentials, API keys, etc.:
     ```
     secretKey = your_secret_key
     port = your_port
     OPENAI_API_KEY = your_openai_api_key
     user_name = your_username(mysql)
     password = your_password(mysql)
     host = your_host(mysql)
     databasename = your_databasename(mysql)
     ```

4. Run the Flask development server:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Set up the Angular frontend:

   - Navigate to the `BiteBook/client` directory:
     ```
     cd ../client
     ```
   - Install Angular CLI (if not already installed):
     ```
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```
   - Install frontend dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Update the backend URL in `src/environments/environment.ts`:
     ```
     export const environment = {
       production: false,
       backendUrl: 'http://localhost:5000', // Update this URL with your Flask app's URL
     };
     ```
   - Save the file after making changes.

6. Run the Angular app:

   ```
   npm run ng serve
   ```

   - The app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:4200`.

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see the Bite Book App in action.
